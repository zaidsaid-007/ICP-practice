. To make an API call in Motoko, you can use the Http.request function, which sends an HTTP request to a specified URL and returns the response as a HttpResponse object

. Here's an example of how you can make an API call in Motoko:

import Http "mo:base/Http";

public shared func fetch_data() : async Text {
  let response = await Http.request({
    url = "https://your-api-url",
    method = Http.Method.GET,
    headers = [],
    body = null
  });

  if (response.status_code == Http.Status.OK) {
    return response.body_text();
  } else {
    return "Error: " # Int.to_text(response.status_code);
  }
}




This code imports the Http module and defines a fetch_data function that sends an HTTP GET request to a specified URL and returns the response as a Text object. You can modify the code according to your specific requirements and the structure of your API.
